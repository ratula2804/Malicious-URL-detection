# Malicious-URL-detection
Developed a machine learning algorithm which uses various features to classify any URL as benign or malicious

Python based Malicious URL detection system, using machine learning and various feature extraction methods

The main goal is to finally find those feature that are insignificant using information gain of features in random forest method. Which in turn reduces the latency in finding the value of features that aren't actually affecting the accurcay of model.

TIPS: Please read code and execute carefully because most of the thing are location specifc, modify them according to your data locations.
